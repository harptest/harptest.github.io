## Home:

Like start of wills better with combo of his two designs

Mix two ideas, with autoscroll bar and section title, similar to ashleys bit but animated on scroll

More like wills color scheme

Add new simplified partners part more traditional

## About:

Wills layout to start, but maybe less text and shorter intro

Team cards is cool on wills

Maybe mix year dropdown for previous members from ashleys and categories from wills

Ashleys grid layout for previous


Like the join our team layout from ashley, maybe replace wills stay in the loop bit with wills colors and ashleys layout


## Products page:

Want featured product on home. Product page should be like ashleys portal page but with dark theme and like products from ashleys product pages

With less curve layout


## Open source page:

like wills project page


Future Projects should be different layout. Maybe different name, like plan or something


## Articles Page:


Ashleys page vibe, but with wills llayout replacing teh explore bit, maybe as a general search for the website instead?


## Login page:

Like wills


need to def shrink size of AAS application. Would prefer it actually gets its own light theme page



## Overall:


need to create version of OG bakcground design thats flowey but animated. Lottie files for efficiency if possible?

Want curvey bits but with gengraph designs animated and integrated into the site.
